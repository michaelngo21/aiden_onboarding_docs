# aiden_onboarding_docs
This is simply a compilation of notes I took during my time as a computational research intern at the Aiden Lab that I consider both beneficial and broadly-applicable for myself and future interns. It largely covers topics existing outside of the formal onboarding training.
Those topics include: 
- a beginner's guide to the command-line interface
- basic notes on commonly used sequencing techniques
- notes on using Slurm Workload Manager and the lab's specific supercomputing cluster.

Links to the resources that these notes were derived from are provided within each file.
